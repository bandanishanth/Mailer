# Mailer

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

A simple mailer program that can send multiple emails built with Python 3.

## Description

This project came about when I noticed my AMC (Academic Monitoring Chairperson) manually typing out emails to parents of all the students of her section (60+ students!). This problem screamed for the need to automate it.

This script began taking shape ever since I was a beginner in Python, so you get to see various iterations of the quality of the code :sweat_smile:

> This is just a hobby project.

## Requirements
- `smtplib`: The in-built SMTP package for sending the emails.
- `getpass`: A command-line password input handler for Python.
- Email credentials for sending the emails.
