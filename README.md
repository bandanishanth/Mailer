# Mailer
A Simple Mailer Program that can send multiple emails using Python.

Description:

This Project came about when i saw my AMC (Academic Monitoring Chairperson ) manually typing out Emails to parents (62 of them!).

This problem screamed for the need to automate it.

This project began ever since i was a beginner to Python and you get to see the various iterations of the Quality of the code :).
